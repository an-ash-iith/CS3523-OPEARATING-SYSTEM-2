Introduction:- It is c++ code to implement readerwriter problem with (writer prefernce) and fair reader writer problem.

//code1

//reader writer (with writer preference)
file name:- compile using:- g++ rw_CE21BTECH11008.cpp-o rw_CE21BTECH11008
execute:- ./rw_CE21BTECH11008.out
Input-first line nw nr kw kr mucs murem

// fair reader writer
file name:- compile using:- g++ frw_CE21BTECH11008.cpp-o frw_CE21BTECH11008
execute:- ./frw_CE21BTECH11008.out
Input-first line nw nr kw kr mucs murem


//input:-
inp-params.txt
contain only one line 
nw nr kw kr mucs murem

//output :-
creating two output file 
RW-log.txt and FairRW-log.txt 
first for reader writer with writer preference and second one fair reader writer which contain log details of each algorithm

//another file 
Average time.txt
to keep average time and worst time for each algorithm
