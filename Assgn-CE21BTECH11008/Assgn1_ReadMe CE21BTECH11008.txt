Introduction:- It is c++ code to provide multithreading matrix multiplication
my file name is CE21BTECH11008_LAB5

//bunch type 
file name:- compile using:- g++ Assign_src_CE21BTECH11008_Bunch.cpp
execute:- ./a.out

//mix type 
file name:- compile using:- g++ Assign_src_CE21BTECH11008_mix.cpp
execute:- ./a.out

//Myapproach type 
file name:- compile using:- g++ Assign_src_CE21BTECH11008_MYapproach.cpp
execute:- ./a.out

"g++ source.cpp -o output"  can also be used for getting executable file name as "output"
  
take input from : in.txt

first line:- contain N followed by K  (N= size followed bu number of thread)
second onward matrix with each element seoparated by " " and each row ending with '/0'

runnung will give the result outfile.txt
